Completed steps 1 - 4 and the extra credit step 1. I learnt a hard lesson on the difference between .querySelector() and .querSelectorAll() as well as a very disgusting lesson in attaching EventListeners. Who knew you had to attach eventListeners to every iteration of the tile on creation for it to work or to call it in a function.... me now. It's fun so far. I'll work on the second extra credit step later
